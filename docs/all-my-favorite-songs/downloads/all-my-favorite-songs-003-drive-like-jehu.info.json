"description": "Drive Like Jehu was an American post-hardcore band from San Diego active from 1990 to 1995. It was formed by rhythm guitarist and vocalist Rick Froberg and lead guitarist John Reis, ex-members of Pitchfork, along with bassist Mike Kennedy and drummer Mark Trombino, both from Night Soil Man, after their two bands disbanded in 1990. Drive Like Jehu's music was characterized by passionate singing, unusual song structure, indirect melodic themes, intricate guitar playing, and calculated use of tension, resulting in a distinctive sound amongst other post-hardcore acts and helped to catalyze the evolution of hardcore punk into emo. \n\n In this episode all songs by bands selected by Drive Like Jehu to play All Tomorrow's Parties 2.0 April 22-24, 2016. \n\n Lineup:\n Hot Snakes, The Blind Shake, Mrs. Magician, Flamin' Groovies, The King Khan & BBQ Show, The Schizophonics, Metz, Mission Of Burma, The Gories, King Khan and the Shrines, The Spits, Rocket From The Crypt, Betunizer, The Monkeywrench, Holly Golightly, Dan Sartain, Martin Rev, Tortoise, The Ex, PyPy, Gary Wilson, Claw Hammer, Wau y Los Arrrghs",
