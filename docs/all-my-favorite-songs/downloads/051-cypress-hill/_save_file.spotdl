(M\u00edrame a los ojos, ver\u00e1s lo que soy)\n\u00bfMe comprendes, Mendes? (M\u00edrame a los ojos, ver\u00e1s lo que soy)\n\u00bfMe comprendes, Mendes?

Everybody's gonna move their feet\n(Get down!) Everybody\u2032s gonna leave their seat\nYou gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City\n(Get up!) Everybody\u2032s gonna move their feet\n(Get down!) Everybody's gonna leave their seat\n\nGetting late, I just can\u2032t wait\nTen o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road\nFirst I drink, then I smoke\nStart the car and I try to make the midnight show\n\n(Get up!) Everybody\u2032s gonna move their feet\n(Get down!) Everybody's gonna leave their seat\n\nMovin\u2032 fast, doin' 95\nHit top speed but I'm still movin\u2032 much too slow\nI feel so good, I\u2032m so alive\nI hear my song playin' on the radio\nIt goes\n\n(Get up!) Everybody\u2032s gonna move their feet\n(Get down!) Everybody's gonna leave their seat\n\nYou gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City\n\nTwelve o\u2032clock, I gotta rock\nThere's a truck ahead, lights starin\u2032 at my eyes\nOh my God, no time to turn\nI got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die\nWhy?\n\n(Get up!) Everybody\u2032s gonna move their feet\n(Get down!)\n(Get up!) Everybody\u2032s gonna leave their seat\n(Get down!)",
