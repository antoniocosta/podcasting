  "description": "Roger Buzz Osborne (born March 25, 1964), also known as King Buzzo, is an American guitarist, vocalist and songwriter. He is a founding member of the Melvins, as well as Fantômas and Venomous Concept. As founder of the Melvins, Buzz Osborne was one of the most influential figures in alternative rock during the 1980s and '90s and continued to produce a fascinating body of work well into the new millennium, though his impact often came second-hand. Osborne's massive, often sludgy guitar tone and bulldozer melodic structures were a major influence on the rise of the grunge scene in the Pacific Northwest as well as later varieties of off-center heavy rock, and as a mentor to his friend Kurt Cobain, Osborne helped guide Nirvana's early sound, and his importance was often cited by Cobain after Nevermind made him a major star. \n\n Lineup:\n ISIS, The Rolling Stones, Metallica, Black Flag, The Who, Hüsker Dü, The Replacements, Jimi Hendrix, Cows, The Birthday Party",
