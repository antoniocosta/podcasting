  "description": "James Newell Osterberg Jr. (born April 21, 1947), known professionally as Iggy Pop, is an American musician, singer, and songwriter. Designated the 'Godfather of Punk', he was the vocalist and lyricist of proto-punk band The Stooges, who were formed in 1967 and have disbanded and reunited many times since. Years before punk musicians became known for antagonistic on-stage behavior, Pop mastered an unhinged approach to performance that sometimes endangered himself and spectators alike. Pop's music has encompassed a number of styles over the course of his career, including garage rock, punk rock, hard rock, heavy metal, art rock, new wave, jazz, blues, and electronic.\n\n This episode features Pop's 5 most influential songs, as shared with ABC's Nightline in 2010, as well as one track from each of Pop's 12 favorite albums of all time, as shared with Far Out magazine in 2021. \n\n Lineup:\n Frank Sinatra, The Ronettes, The Shangri-Las, Muddy Waters with Orchestra, Link Wray, Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Traffic, Marty Robbins, James Brown & The Famous Flames, Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, John Coltrane, Louis Armstrong & His Hot Five, R.L.
