The band was founded by J Mascis (guitar, vocals, primary songwriter), Lou Barlow (bass, vocals), and Murph (drums). After three albums on independent labels, the band earned a reputation as one of the formative influences on American alternative rock. Mascis's drawling vocals and distinct guitar sound, hearkening back to 1960s and 1970s classic rock and characterized by extensive use of feedback and distortion, were highly influential in the alternative rock movement of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> Lineup:<br /> Wipers / The Dream Syndicate / True West / The Jesus and Mary Chain / The Birthday Party / Throbbing Gristle / Venom / Accept / Saint Vitus / The Eastern Dark / The Neats / Green On Red / Meat Puppets"}
