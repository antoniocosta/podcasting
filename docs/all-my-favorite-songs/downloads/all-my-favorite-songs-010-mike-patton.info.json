  "description": "Michael Allan Patton (born January 27, 1968) is an American singer, producer, film composer and voice actor, best known as the lead vocalist of the alternative metal band Faith No More. Noted for his vocal proficiency, diverse singing techniques, wide range of projects, style-transcending influences, eccentric public image and contempt for the music industry, Patton has earned critical praise and influenced many contemporary singers. One of the most versatile, innately talented, and idiosyncratic singers in rock music, Mike Patton is also one of the genre's most valuable players, since he has divided his time between a host of diverse projects including Faith No More, Mr. Bungle, Fantômas, Tomahawk, Peeping Tom, Nevermen, Dead Cross, and an experimental solo career. In addition to his band and solo work, Patton is a gifted actor and producer who has collaborated with a wide array of artists, including John Zorn, Sepultura, Melvins, Melt Banana, and Kool Keith. \n\n Lineup:\n Bad Brains, Don Black, John Barry, Tom Jones, Young Fathers, Quincy Jones, Don Elliott, Terveet Kädet, Dead Cross, Jacques Brel, Tom Dissevelt, White Noise, Charlie Parr, Messer Chups, João Gilberto, Funkadelic, Die Kreuzen, Adriano Celentano, Conlon Nancarrow, Bösendorfer Grand Piano, Dion Mcgregor, Basil Kirchin, Chet Baker, Nino Rota, Sun Ra, The Cosmic Rays",
