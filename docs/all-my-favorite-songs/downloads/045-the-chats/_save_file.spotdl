        "lyrics": "Yeah\nFor your eyes only\n(For your eyes)\nFor your eyes only, for your eyes only\n(For your eyes)\nFor your eyes only\n\nHey\nNiggas be dying on the daily\nIt seems my dreams faded for far too long, the consequences deadly\nCan′t visualize myself as nothing but a criminal\nControl the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal\n'Cause young niggas is hard headed, they letting off\nFull of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause\nAin′t no coming back, family dressed in black\nPlus it's hot now, the cops outside it's hard to flip a pack\n\nAnd my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me\nLike I ain′t the one who put them Jays on her feet\nLike I ain′t out in the field like that\nI might be low for the moment but I will bounce back\nDespite the charges, back to the wall I fight regardless\nScreaming \"Fuck the law\", my life is lawless\nThat's what you call it\nAin′t got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven\nThis is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic\n\nI try to find employment even if it′s wiping toilets\nBut these felonies be making life the hardest\nResisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet\nOr run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it\nThat's why I write this sonnet\nIf the pressure get too much for me to take and I break\nPlay this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it\n(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it\n(For your eyes) For your eyes only\n\nFor your eyes, do you understand?\nFor your eyes, do you understand me?\nFor your eyes, do you understand?\nFor your eyes, do you understand me?\nFor your eyes, do you understand?\nFor your eyes, do you understand me?\nFor your eyes, do you understand?\nFor your eyes only\n\nYou′re probably grown now so this song'll hit you\nIf you're hearing this, unfortunately means that I′m no longer with you\nIn the physical, not even sure if I believe in God\nBut because you still alive\nHe got me praying that the spiritual is real\nSo I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too\nSo I know how part of you feels\nMaybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me\nLife goes in cycles, maybe you′ll date a nigga just like me\n\nI hope not, I'm tired of dope spots\nAnd fiends that smoke rocks\nI′ve seen far too many niggas hopes rot\nI'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance\nNow I see death around the corner, apologizing in advance\nDon′t know if I ever had a chance\nAt a glance I'm a failure, addicted to pushing paraphernalia\nBut Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once\nInnocence disappeared by the age of eight years\n\nMy Pops shot up, drug related\nMama addicted\nSo Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging\nBlood was staining the concrete\nOlder niggas I loved talked like they was above maintaining a time sheet\nThat slow money, picked up the family business\nBy the age of thirteen, six years later was handed sentence\n′Round the same time you came in this world\nMe and your mama thinking, what the fuck we naming this girl?\n\nI told her Nina, the prettiest name that I could think of\nFor the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen\nI was nineteen, it took me two felonies to see the trap\nThis crooked ass system set for me\nAnd now I fear it's too late for me to ever be\nThe one that set examples that was never set for me\nI'm living fast, but not fast enough ′cause karma keeps catching up to me\nAnd if my past becomes the death of me, I hope you understand\n\nFor your eyes, do you understand?\nFor your eyes, do you understand me?\nFor your eyes, do you understand?\nFor your eyes, do you understand me?\nFor your eyes, do you understand?\nFor your eyes, do you understand me?\nFor your eyes, do you understand?\nFor your eyes only\n\nIn several ways I could′ve went out, too many to count\nWas it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?\nWas it the young nigga, blasting frustrated 'cause the cash running out?\nNiggas don′t know how to act in a drought\nSee baby girl I realized, my definition of a real nigga was skewed\nMy views misshaped by new mixtapes\nThat confirmed the shit I learned from in the streets was true\nThat real niggas don't speak when they beef with you\n\nThey just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo\nAnd if a real nigga hungry he gon′ eat your food\nI was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops\nDucking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you\nI pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views\nMuch broader than the corner, if not it′s gon' corner you\nInto a box, where your son don't even know his pops\nAnd the cyclical nature of doing time continues\n\nMy worst fear is one day that you come home from school\nAnd see your father face while hearing ′bout tragedy on news\nI got the strangest feeling your Daddy gonna lose his life soon\nAnd sadly if you′re listening now it must mean it's true\nBut maybe there′s a chance that it's not\nAnd this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels\nAnd I can teach you this in person like I′m teaching you to tie your own shoes\nI love you and I hope to God I don't lose you\n\nFor your eyes only\nFor your eyes\nFor your eyes only\n\nFor your eyes\nFor your eyes only\nFor your eyes do you understand?\nFor your eyes only\n\nOne day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling\nWhat he′d been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling\nI tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing\nBut I could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling\nHe said \"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children I never asked for nothing\nWhen times was hard I never had discussions with you begging you to help me\nI dealt with the repercussions of my actions\nI know you tried to steer me away from that shit\n\nBut that shit was in my blood, you know my life\nI know your momma nigga, send my love\nIn case I never get a chance to speak again\nI won′t forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib\nThat′s the way I wished my family lived\nBut my granny crib was in the 'jects\nI had to interject like, \"Nigga what you talking ′bout? Fuck is you getting at?\"\nHe said \"Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions\nBut I've been having premonitions, just call it visions from the other side\n\nI got a feeling I won′t see tomorrow, like the time I'm living on is borrowed\nWith that said I′m proud to say I was a father\nWrite my story down and if I pass go play it for my daughter when she ready\nAnd so I'm leaving you this record for your eyes only\nDon't you ever scratch or disrespect it\nThis perspective is a real one, another lost Ville son\nI dedicate these words to you and all the other children\n\nAffected by all the mass incarceration in this nation\nThat sent your pops to prison when he needed education\nSometimes I think this segregation would′ve done us better\nAlthough that means that I would never be brought into this world\n′Cause my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl\nTo take back to Jonesborough with Little Zach and Cole World\nBarely one years old, now it's thirty years later making sure the story′s told\nGirl your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold\nNot because he was the first to get some pussy twelve years old\n\nNot because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues\nNot ′cause he went from bagging up them grams to serving Os\nNow your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cos he was hard\nNot because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars\nNot because he screamed fuck the law, although that was true\nYour daddy was a real nigga ′cause he loved you\"\nFor your eyes only"

(Comment on shit)\nEspecially shit you don′t like (shit you don't like)\nDon't like it, don′t listen\nBut don′t tell me 'bout your favorite rapper rippin′\nSome shit he didn't write (shit he didn′t write)\n\nWhat happened to Slim? He was no cap with the pen\nHe used to rap like the people his music was for\nHe was exactly like them\nThe dude who used to be poor, why can't he tap into him?\nCan′t use that excuse anymore\nHe's mad at the wind, he's in a nuclear war\nWith a cloud, he′s yellin′ at it again\n\nI talked to your mother, she told me she loved me\nAll she wanna do is just hold me and hug me\nWants nobody but me, she showed me the Dougie\nCan I get a witness like notary public? (Preach)\nShe said, \"Kick some fly shit\" (fly shit)\nI said, \"I got wings on my ass\" (wings on my ass)\nTold her my dick's a cockpit (dick′s a cockpit)\nI fly by the seat of my pants (seat of my pants)\n\nSinful thoughts, this beat is crazy, this shit's retarded\nThis instru′s mental (this instru's mental) to mini-bars, incidental charges\nWhen did it start? I been cold-hearted in this heart since kindergarten\nMental sharpness which makes Slim a walking dentist office\nBitch, I invented flossin′\n\nYeah, I used to wonder (I used to wonder)\nWhere my next meal's gonna come from (meal's gonna come from)\nNow, I just wonder (now I just wonder)\nWhere my next mill′s gonna come from (mill′s gonna come from)\nI cannot have no success (have no success)\nUnless when I finally make it (finally make it)\nI get to remind all the haters (remind all the haters)\nWho shitted on me when I'm on my way up (I′m on my way)\n\nMy floor is y'all fool′s ceilings\nIf I was you, I would step or find yourself twisted\nThat's how you′ll wind up like spiral stairs\nI will swear on a stack of Bibles\nI will tear new behinds out of rivals, even your idols, I don't care\nIt's Music to Be Murdered By\nSo Bon Iver can swallow a fuckin′ Ja Rule bobblehead\n\nAnd die slow like Alzheimer′s (ha-ha)\nLone sniper, I hold a microphone like a loaded rifle\nMy dome's brighter, all I spit from my skull′s fire\nAll that's missing′s a motorcycle with the chrome wires, spoke tires\nAnd y'all are flow biters, so I don′t gotta\nExplain why they call me your ghostwriter\n\nI'm emptyin' (I′m emptyin′) my book of rhymes (my book of rhymes)\nGet 'em all off my pad, every thought that I had\nI said I′m emptyin' (I′m emptyin') my book of rhymes (my book of rhymes)\nGet ′em all off my pad, every thought that I had (Illa)\n\nHaven't used all the tricks I have, so like my balls, it's in my bag\nI tend to get a little testy when I′m mad\nBut gift of gab and pen to pad turn temper tantrums into anthems\nPut lips to ass and kiss the cracks, spit your damnedest\nYou′re still gonna hit the canvas\nRippin' rappers, veterans to whippersnappers\nMr. Mathers is killin′ this shit, villainous wit with scant less\n\nSyllables rip the planet, biblical shit's fittin′ to hit the fan\nAnybody wanna go tit for tat's gonna get hit with that\nThen the amygdala hippocampus is gonna trigger the ignoramus\nTo think of the most ridiculous shit to spit then\nPit it against these pitiful rappers\nInsidious, these idiots wittiest shit against me shitty as MC Hammer′s\n\nGet your whole squad, send a task force in\nIf you want it, you're 'bout to get what you asked for then\nPut your helmet on, strap your chin\nYou′re ′bout to get you a crash course in\nWho not to start a motherfuckin' rap war with\nOr to go against, fuck would you wanna do that for?\nNo offense, but are you retards slow or dense?\nA fuckin′ penny has more sense\n\nYeah, now you gotta get killed\nBut it's not a big deal, but every thought is so ill\nAnd so methodical, thought I swallowed a pill\nI′m starting to feel like I'm an automobile\nWith Barnacle Bill inside the car at the wheel\nInside a carnival\n′Cause I'm plowin' into everyone who wrote snidey articles\nAnd that explains why the fuck you clowns are all in my grill\n\nJoy and pain, fortune, fame, torture, shame, choice I made\nSwore someday the world would pay less to lose\nMore to gain, daughters raised\nYesterday, glory days, adored and praised, ignored the hate\nAddressed the fake, toured with Dre, tore a page from Jordan came\nDestroyed the game before you came, enjoy your stay\n\nBefore it′s gone away\nBut the more you claim that you′re gonna point and aim\nIf it joined a gang, your shit isn't going to bang\nYou′re just boring, lame and more of the same\nYou have an enormous chain, but a stormless brain\nThe most you can form is rain\nYour shit is pointless, same as a scoreless game\nSo, bitch, quit lyin', you′re denyin' like Mr. Porter′s name\n\nBorderline bipolar disorder since my stroller\nEyes rollin' back in my skull like Eli Porter\nFire mortar (brr) rounds, Ayatollah, every iota I load up\nI owe to my motor mouth\nThis is my note to self\nSometimes you're gonna bomb\nSo you just might have to blow yourself up with no one′s help\nI just wrote it down in my book of rhymes\nPreemo, take us out\n\nWritin′ in my book of rhymes\nMy book of rhymes, my book of rhymes\nI'm, I′m, I'm, I′m, I'm, I′m eastside\nWritin' in my book of rhymes\nMy book of rhymes, my book of rhymes\nI'm, I′m, I′m, I'm, I′m, I'm eastside"
