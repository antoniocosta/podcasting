Simpson: not a Jew\nBut guess who is? Hall-of-famer Rod Carew (he converted)\nWe got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby\nHarrison Ford′s a quarter Jewish, not too shabby!\n\nSome people think that Ebenezer Scrooge is\nWell, he's not, but guess who is? All Three Stooges!\nSo many Jews are in showbiz\nTom Cruise isn′t, but I heard his agent is\n\nTell your friend Veronica\nIt's time you celebrate Chanukah\nI hope I get a harmonica\nOn this lovely, lovely Chanukah\n\nSo drink your gin and tonic-ah\nAnd smoke your marijuani-kkah\nIf you really, really wanna-kkha\nHave a happy, happy, happy, happy Chanukah\n\nHappy Chanukah!"

It's like the game ain′t the same\nGot younger niggas pulling the triggers, bringing fame to their name\nAnd claim some corners, crews without guns are goners\nIn broad daylight, stickup kids, they run up on us\n4-5's and gauges, MAC's, in fact\nSame niggas will catch a back-to-back, snatching your cracks in black\nThere was a snitch on the block getting niggas knocked\nSo hold your stash ′til the coke price drop\n\nI know this crackhead who said she′s got to smoke nice rock\nAnd if it's good, she′ll bring you customers in measuring pots\nBut yo, you gotta slide on a vacation, inside information\nKeeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin′\nIt drops deep as it does in my breath\nI never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death\nBeyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined\nI think of crime when I′m in a New York state of mind\n\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\n\nBe having dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinking Moets, holding TECs\nMaking sure the cash came correct, then I stepped\nInvestments in stocks, sewing up the blocks to sell rocks\nWinning gunfights with mega-cops\nBut just a nigga walking with his finger on the trigger\nMake enough figures until my pockets get bigger\nI ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin′\nGive me a Smith & Wesson, I have niggas undressin′\n\nThinking of cash flow, buddah and shelter\nWhenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta\nIn the P.J.′s, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays\nYoung bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze\nFull of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed\nFrom what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back, black\nI'm living where the nights is jet-black\nThe fiends fight to get crack I just max, I dream I can sit back\n\nAnd lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn\nOr the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes\nI got so many rhymes I don′t think I'm too sane\nLife is parallel to Hell but I must maintain\nAnd be prosperous, though we live dangerous, cops could just\nArrest me, blaming us, we′re held like hostages\nIt's only right that I was born to use mics\nAnd the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes\n\nI'm taking rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow\nMy rhymin′ is a vitamin held without a capsule\nThe smooth criminal on beat breaks\nNever put me in your box if your shit eats tapes\nThe city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps\nThat′s where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks\nI'm an addict for sneakers, 20s of buddah and bitches with beepers\nIn the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya\n\nInhale deep like the words of my breath\nI never sleep, ′cause sleep is the cousin of death\nI lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times\nNothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind\n\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\n\nNasty Nas\nNasty Nas\nNas\nNasty Nas\nNasty Nas\nNas\nNas\nNasty Nas\nNasty Nas\nNasty Nas\nNasty Nas\nNasty Nas\nNasty Nas"
