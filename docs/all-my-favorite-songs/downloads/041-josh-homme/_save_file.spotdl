        "lyrics": "Woah! If it isn′t a Lightner!\nHey hey hey hey hey hey!\nLooks like you're all alone on a late night?\nAll your friends abandoned you for the slime you are?\nSales gone down the drain? Drain?\nLiving in a goddamn garbage can?\nHae-ahaa-hae-ahaa-eah!\n\nFriend, either you′re closing your eyes\nTo savings you do not wish to acknowledge\nOr you are not aware of the calibre of discounts\nIndicated by the presence of a heart-shaped object\nIn your community\n\nHey, kid, look at you! Right time, right place!\nRipe for the picking! Right money in your pocket!\nYou're so lucky! Very lucky! Oh, so very, very lucky!\nThat you get to be investing in this Very Special Product\nFrom everybody's favourite number one rated salesman\nCirca 1997, mighty proud to say it! Mighty proud to say it!\nYes, I′m mighty proud to say it! Yes, sir!\n\nDon′t you wanna have a little fun, little sponge?\nLittle something to pluck you from the glum humdrum?\nLive comfortably, capital at risk! Yum, yum!\nListen up! For the offer only comes just once!\nHey, chum! I can see you're having violent thoughts!\nBut don′t you wanna wanna be a be a big shot?\nEnquire today! While the secret's in stock!\nAll you gotta do is\nHyperlink blocked\n\nI used to be nothing but the email guy\nNow I′m the \"It burns! Ow! Stop! Stop! Help me! It burns!\" guy\n\nWe've got never bettered bargains, we′ve got deals you won't believe\nWe can tell you what you want before you realise what you need\nIf you'll pardon us the jargon, here′s our Darkner guarantee\nWe take cash or card or credit, but we′ll take your heart for free\n\nAre you feeling down? Have you lost control?\nIs your life a mess? Do your friends despise you?\nWell, here's one weird trick discovered by a mom\nAnd I′m sure number five will surprise you\n\nAll you've ever dreamed of, shining, glistening\nGotta buckle up! Grab life by the silly string!\nYou can have it! You can have it! Say the word, it′s yours!\nEahaehaehaehaeh! I wasn't listening\n\nSee, it says just here, right here, last year\nOn the third of the fourth at five-o-six\nYou searched cat pics online, well, that′s just fine\nMoist, delicious cookies\n\nLittle tippy tap kitty catalyst\nNow we have a list\nAnd we'll guess what ever habit is\nWanna buy a cat flap? Cat food? Catchup? Catamaran?\nYou'll be categorically catatonic\n\nAt the catalogue of categories I have at my hands\nA cavalcade of all your favourite brands\nAn advertism schism cataclysm, cash on demand!\nYou′d better cancel your plans!\nCash for the crackers and the pickles and the flypaper!\n\nWanna buy a cat plush? Plush toy? Toy box? Box wine?\nWhy won′t Mike just call me?\nBackgammon? Ham and eggs? Egg chair? Chair bed?\nBed bath? Bath sponge?\nSponge who hates it's $4.99?\nLife boat? Boat shoe? Shoestring? String bean?\nBean bag? Bagpipes? Pipe bomb? Bomber jacket?\nJackdaw? Doorstop?\nStop! No, please! Don′t take my furniture!\n\nStopwatch? Watchdog? Dog collar? Colorado?\nAdderall? Ads are all seeping! Ping pong? Ponchos?\nChoke chains? Chainsaws? Swordfish-shish kebab-bobcat?\nDo you want a cat or not?\n\nWell, you wanna be a big shot, don't you?\nDon′t you wanna be the next big thing?\nYou can do it! Yes, it's true, it′s really true\nThere's nothing to it, I can prove it!\nHear the registers ring!\n\nRing, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring\nYou're kidding? It′s for you\nWanna know a secret?\nHyperlink blocked\n\nYou too can have a communion with—\nSoon, I′ll even surpass that damned clown around town!\n\nWe've got never bettered bargains, we′ve got deals you won't believe\nWe can tell you what you want before you realise what you need\nIf you′ll pardon us the jargon, here's our Darkner guarantee\nWe take cash or card or credit, but we′ll take your heart for free\n\nHoly cungadero, there, you funky, little worm\nYou seem unaware of all the money you could earn\nIf you wanna get the gold\nWell, there is stuff you gotta learn\nMilk the humans of their kindness\nThen there's butter to be churned\n\nYou. Want. It. Need. It!\nDon't. You. See?\nBut if you wanna make your screen green\nYou′re gonna need my Kromer key\n\nYes, you′ve got trouble, my friend! Whadayatalk?\nRight here in Cyber City!\nSee, I used to be a top notch! Big shot!\nBest deals! Best wheels! Best prices in the tri-state area\n\nBut you can get it back! Ha-ha-ha! Yes, you can!\nAll you gotta do is follow through my 12-step plan\nBigger, bigger, better, like the telephone was telling me\nYou gotta know the territory! Spend a hand, lend a hand\n\nWho's gonna patronise a little bitty\nTwo by four kinda store anymore?\nGotta go! Gotta get! Gotta get on and go!\nMake a deal! Big deal! High score! Our store is closing!\n\nHot tip! Drop shipping! Four, three, two, one!\nNot skipping offers wired into your inbox\nSwing by the gift shop! Think of the big shot!\nAll this and more, click\nHyperlink blocked\n\nCan anyone hear me?\nHelp\nMike\nMike?\nHa-ha-ha-ha!\n\nWe′ve got never bettered bargains, we've got deals you won′t believe\nWe can tell you what you want before you realise what you need\nIf you'll pardon us the jargon, here′s our Darkner guarantee\nWe take cash or card or credit, but we'll take your heart for free\n\nInsurance! Know that I'm the best in policy!\nHonestly, do you wanna end in poverty?\nBuddy, I′m the one to help invest it properly!\nI′m here to talk about extended warranty!\n\nIt's a super, bumper, liquidation, last chance\nFirst day, half price, fire sale like never before!\nAnd it′s there to explore, when you step in the door\nThe very model of a modern major general store!\n\nBut the fact is everybody's gotta have it, gotta have it\nThose who have it really have it\nIf you haven′t, well, you've had it, couldn′t hack it\nNow the haven'ts haven't had it and the haves are very glad it′s\nJust the haven′ts that're lacking what they′re having\n\nNow the ads have got the traffic\nAnd we've grabbed your demographic\nSo you′re packing up your basket\n'Cause your dad has gotta have it\nHe′ll be sad if you don't wrap it with a tag, it'll be tragic\nSo you′re manically grabbing at the shelves amid the panic\n\nSeems that everybody has it, man, you really gotta have it\nSo you get it, you′re ecstatic, but a crackle in the static\nAnd the it is out of fashion, just a fad, a piece of plastic\nSo you trash it, then you get back in your car 'cause you don′t have it\n\nAnd the fact is everybody's gotta have it, gotta have it\nThose who have it really have it\nIf you haven′t, well, you've had it, couldn′t hack it\nNow the haven'ts haven't had it and the haves are very glad it′s\nHochi mama! What a mouthful!\n\nIn the encyclopedia of being afraid\nThere ain′t nothing to be scared of 'til there′s fees to be paid\nThere's deals to be made with seasonal savings!\nRegional ratings are lethally fading\n\nScreaming and raving, ceaseless appraising\nNeat, little plate with a needless engraving\nLegally grey, but sweet with the phrasing\nFeet in the grave, but gleefully trading\n\nFeeding the cravings, eat, little plaything\nDeals so good I′ll— myself\nFeeding the cravings, eat, little plaything\nGone with the sugar barrel, pickle barrel, milk pan\nFeeding the cravings, eat, little plaything\nI can feel that smooth taste already!\nFeeding the cravings, eat, little plaything\nHyperlink blocked"
