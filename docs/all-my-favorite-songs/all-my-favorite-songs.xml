                <description>Frank Vincent Zappa (December 21, 1940 – December 4, 1993) was an American musician, singer, composer, songwriter and bandleader. His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrète works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist.

                <description>Merrill Nisker (born 11 November 1966), better known by her stage name Peaches, is a Canadian electroclash musician and producer who burst into transcontinental favor with her very particular brand of cocksure rapping and groovebox beats. Peaches was an unlikely success story, making her musical mark after the age of 30 in a genre not commonly known for recognizing its female or its aging participants. Her unique rapping style and stage show brought her great popularity first in Europe and then in North America. Some of her lyrics and performances have been rejected due to them being potentially offensive, and a lot of her songs are themed on gender identity. Her work propagates sexual freedom and reversal of gender roles. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In this episode Peaches selecting some of her favourite music for her Wise Women BBC Radio 6 Music takeover on December 2015.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lineup: &lt;br /&gt; A Taste Of Honey, Björk, David Bowie, Missy Elliott, PJ Harvey, L7, L&#39;Trimm, Krisma, Suicide, Light Asylum, Laurie Anderson, Kate Bush, Planningtorock, Roberta Flack, M.I.A., Nire, Maluca, Nani Castle, Lafawndah, Kim Carnes, Savages, Lizzy Mercier Descloux, Sinéad O&#39;Connor, Yma Sumac, Diamanda Galás, The Regrettes, TT The Artist, Althea And Donna</description>

                <description>James Newell Osterberg Jr. (born April 21, 1947), known professionally as Iggy Pop, is an American musician, singer, and songwriter. Designated the &#39;Godfather of Punk&#39;, he was the vocalist and lyricist of proto-punk band The Stooges, who were formed in 1967 and have disbanded and reunited many times since.

                <description>The Hives are a Swedish rock band that rose to prominence in the early 2000s during the Garage Rock Revival. Eight years into their career, the Hives rose from garage rock stalwarts to one of the trendiest bands of the early 2000s, along with the Strokes and the White Stripes. Mixing arty contrivances such as a strict black-and-white dress code and the guidance of a (possibly imaginary) Svengali named Randy Fitzsimmons with Stooges-inspired rock, the Hives - Nicholaus Arson, Chris Dangerous, Dr. Matt Destruction, Vigilante Carlstroem, and Howlin&#39; Pelle Almqvist - formed in 1993 in Fagersta, Sweden, while they were still in their teens.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In this episode the playlist published by the band for New Year&#39;s Eve 2020-21.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lineup: &lt;br /&gt; ABBA, Viagra Boys, Amy Taylor, Los Saicos, The Cramps, ShitKid, Jacqueline Taieb, Hunx &amp; His Punx, First Aid Kit, Tom Waits, Shannon &amp; The Clams, Radioactivity, Turbonegro, The Hives, Oblivians, New Bomb Turks, The Sonics, Thee Headcoatees, Reigning Sound, Richard Hell, Sonic&#39;s Rendezvous Band, The Hellacopters, Dead Kennedys, Ramones, Electric Eels, Bo Diddley, Mohammed Wardi, King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard, Charlie Megira, Julian Casablancas, Franska Trion, Tonbruket, The Wailers, Clinic, Mattiel, The Mysterians, The Stooges</description>

                <description>Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 – c. April 5, 1994) was an American singer, songwriter, artist and musician. He was the frontman of the rock band Nirvana, serving as the band&#39;s guitarist, lead vocalist, and primary songwriter. Through his angst-fueled songwriting and anti-establishment persona, Cobain&#39;s compositions widened the thematic conventions of mainstream rock music. He was often heralded as a spokesman of Generation X and is considered to be one of the most influential musicians in the history of alternative rock.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This episode is based on Kurt&#39;s handwritten list of Top 50 albums, as featured in the 2002 anthology Journals.

                <description>Roger &#39;Buzz&#39; Osborne (born March 25, 1964), also known as King Buzzo, is an American guitarist, vocalist and songwriter. He is a founding member of the Melvins, as well as Fantômas and Venomous Concept. As founder of the Melvins, Buzz Osborne was one of the most influential figures in alternative rock during the 1980s and &#39;90s and continued to produce a fascinating body of work well into the new millennium, though his impact often came second-hand.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Osborne&#39;s massive, often sludgy guitar tone and bulldozer melodic structures were a major influence on the rise of the grunge scene in the Pacific Northwest as well as later varieties of off-center heavy rock, and as a mentor to his friend Kurt Cobain, Osborne helped guide Nirvana&#39;s early sound, and his importance was often cited by Cobain after Nevermind made him a major star.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In this episode Buzz&#39;s A.V. Club January 7 2014 mixtape, of &#39;bands that were good, but blew it&#39;.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lineup: &lt;br /&gt; ISIS, The Rolling Stones, Metallica, Black Flag, The Who, Hüsker Dü, The Replacements, Jimi Hendrix, Cows, The Birthday Party</description>

                <description>Steve Albini (born July 22, 1961) is an American musician, record producer, audio engineer and music journalist. He was a member of Big Black, Rapeman and Flour, and is a member of Shellac. He is the founder, owner and principal engineer of Electrical Audio, a recording studio complex in Chicago. In 2018, Albini estimated that he had worked on several thousand albums over his career. He has worked with acts such as Nirvana, Pixies, the Breeders and PJ Harvey. Albini is also known for his outspoken views on the music industry, having stated repeatedly that it financially exploits artists and homogenizes their sound, as well as the flaws in the digital recording process and the superiority of analog technology.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Albini&#39;s engineering skills have been celebrated for their sense of space, naturalistic tone, and the power of his guitar and drum sounds; his own guitar work is as imaginatively abrasive as his lyrics, which can be challenging and sometimes confrontational. Nearly alone among well-known producers and musicians, Albini refuses to take ongoing royalties from album sales, feeling that a producer&#39;s job is to record the music to the band&#39;s desires, and that paying producers as if they had contributed artistically to an album is unethical.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In this episode, part two of a series of two, all songs selected by Steve Albini as guest for Australian TV show Rage, on June 29 2013.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lineup: &lt;br /&gt; Bill Withers, Stevie Wonder, Repercussions, Curtis Mayfield, Philip Glass, Broadcast, Chrome, Sisters of Mercy, Venom P.

                <description>Steve Albini (born July 22, 1961) is an American musician, record producer, audio engineer and music journalist. He was a member of Big Black, Rapeman and Flour, and is a member of Shellac. He is the founder, owner and principal engineer of Electrical Audio, a recording studio complex in Chicago. In 2018, Albini estimated that he had worked on several thousand albums over his career. He has worked with acts such as Nirvana, Pixies, the Breeders and PJ Harvey. Albini is also known for his outspoken views on the music industry, having stated repeatedly that it financially exploits artists and homogenizes their sound, as well as the flaws in the digital recording process and the superiority of analog technology.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Albini&#39;s engineering skills have been celebrated for their sense of space, naturalistic tone, and the power of his guitar and drum sounds; his own guitar work is as imaginatively abrasive as his lyrics, which can be challenging and sometimes confrontational. Nearly alone among well-known producers and musicians, Albini refuses to take ongoing royalties from album sales, feeling that a producer&#39;s job is to record the music to the band&#39;s desires, and that paying producers as if they had contributed artistically to an album is unethical.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In this episode, part one of a series of two, all songs selected by Steve Albini as guest for Australian TV show Rage, on June 29 2013.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lineup: &lt;br /&gt; The B-52&#39;s, Blondie, The Stranglers, Man Or Astro-Man, Chad Van Gaalen, Lou Reed, The Specials, The Cars, Siouxsie and the Banshees, D.

                <description>Adam Nathaniel Yauch (August 5, 1964 – May 4, 2012), better known under the stage name MCA, was an American rapper, bass player, filmmaker and a founding member of the hip hop group Beastie Boys. Yauch co-founded the Beastie Boys with Mike &#39;Mike D&#39; Diamond and Adam &#39;Ad-Rock&#39; Horovitz in 1979. The band started off as a hardcore punk group, but soon began experimenting with hip-hop. The band broke huge with their first proper album, Licensed to Ill, in 1986; it was the biggest-selling rap album of the decade and the first to reach Number One on the Billboard chart. Further albums Paul’s Boutique, Check Your Head and Ill Communication cemented the Beasties as a true superstar act. Yauch also directed many of the Beastie Boys’ music videos under the pseudonym Nathaniel Hornblower. In 2002, he founded Oscilloscope Laboratories, an independent film production and distribution company based in New York City. As a Buddhist, he was involved in the Tibetan independence movement and organized the Tibetan Freedom Concert.

                <description>Thurston Joseph Moore (born July 25, 1958) is an American musician best known as a member of Sonic Youth. He has also participated in many solo and group collaborations outside Sonic Youth, as well as running the Ecstatic Peace! record label. Thurston Moore&#39;s work with Sonic Youth rearranged the parameters of indie rock to an almost incalculable degree, merging experimental art rock tendencies with unconventional guitar tunings for a sound that would influence generations to come. Moore&#39;s abstract poetic lyrics and perpetually mysterious aura were core ingredients of Sonic Youth&#39;s 30-plus-year run, but also bled into countless side projects and less-frequent solo albums like 1994&#39;s sprawling and loose Psychic Hearts. After the group&#39;s breakup in 2011, Moore continued with his ambitions, ranging from projects like his band Chelsea Light Moving to noisy collaborations with Merzbow and John Zorn to solo albums like 2020&#39;s By the Fire that continued exploring the kind of moody, twisting art rock he&#39;d become an icon of with Sonic Youth. Moore was ranked 34th in Rolling Stone&#39;s 2004 edition of the &#39;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.&#39; In May 2012, Spin published a staff-selected list of the top 100 rock guitarists, and ranked Moore and his Sonic Youth bandmate Lee Ranaldo together at number 1.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lineup: &lt;br /&gt; Tapper Zukie, Patti Smith, Teenage Jesus &amp; The Jerks, MARS, Public Image Ltd., The Slits, The Raincoats, Captain Beefheart &amp; His Magic Band, Alice Cooper, T.

                <description>Michael Allan Patton (born January 27, 1968) is an American singer, producer, film composer and voice actor, best known as the lead vocalist of the alternative metal band Faith No More. Noted for his vocal proficiency, diverse singing techniques, wide range of projects, style-transcending influences, eccentric public image and contempt for the music industry, Patton has earned critical praise and influenced many contemporary singers.

In addition to his band and solo work, Patton is a gifted actor and producer who has collaborated with a wide array of artists, including John Zorn, Sepultura, Melvins, Melt Banana, and Kool Keith.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lineup: &lt;br /&gt; Bad Brains, Don Black, John Barry, Tom Jones, Young Fathers, Quincy Jones, Don Elliott, Terveet Kädet, Dead Cross, Jacques Brel, Tom Dissevelt, White Noise, Charlie Parr, Messer Chups, João Gilberto, Funkadelic, Die Kreuzen, Adriano Celentano, Conlon Nancarrow, Bösendorfer Grand Piano, Dion Mcgregor, Basil Kirchin, Chet Baker, Nino Rota, Sun Ra, The Cosmic Rays</description>

                <description>Slipknot is an American heavy metal band formed in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1995 by percussionist Shawn Crahan, drummer Joey Jordison and bassist Paul Gray. After several lineup changes in its early years, the band settled on nine members for more than a decade: Crahan, Jordison, Gray, Craig Jones, Mick Thomson, Corey Taylor, Sid Wilson, Chris Fehn, and Jim Root. Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced during 2011–2014 by guitarist Donnie Steele. Slipknot&#39;s mix of grinding, post-Korn alternative metal, Marilyn Manson-esque neo-shock rock, and rap-metal helped make them one of the most popular bands in the nu-metal explosion of the late 1990s and early 2000s. But even more helpful was their theatrical, attention-grabbing image: the band always performed in identical industrial jump suits and homemade Halloween masks, and added to their mysterious anonymity by adopting the numbers zero through eight as stage aliases. Add to that a lyrical preoccupation with darkness and nihilism, and an affectionately insulting name for their fans (&#39;Maggots&#39;), and Slipknot&#39;s blueprint for nu-metal success was set.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lineup: &lt;br /&gt; Slipknot, Talking Heads, S.O.D. Stormtroopers of Death, Dangerous Toys, Iron Maiden, Ho99o9, Refused, Public Enemy, Marilyn Manson, White Zombie, Slayer, Venom, Megadeth, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Misfits, Glenn Danzig, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Testament, Alice Cooper, Behemoth, Neurosis, Mötley Crüe, Concrete Blonde, W.A.S.P.</description>

                <description>Drive Like Jehu was an American post-hardcore band from San Diego active from 1990 to 1995. It was formed by rhythm guitarist and vocalist Rick Froberg and lead guitarist John Reis, ex-members of Pitchfork, along with bassist Mike Kennedy and drummer Mark Trombino, both from Night Soil Man, after their two bands disbanded in 1990. Drive Like Jehu&#39;s music was characterized by passionate singing, unusual song structure, indirect melodic themes, intricate guitar playing, and calculated use of tension, resulting in a distinctive sound amongst other post-hardcore acts and helped to catalyze the evolution of hardcore punk into emo.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In this episode all songs by bands selected by Drive Like Jehu to play All Tomorrow&#39;s Parties 2.0 April 22-24, 2016.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lineup: &lt;br /&gt; Hot Snakes, The Blind Shake, Mrs. Magician, Flamin&#39; Groovies, The King Khan &amp; BBQ Show, The Schizophonics, Metz, Mission Of Burma, The Gories, King Khan and the Shrines, The Spits, Rocket From The Crypt, Betunizer, The Monkeywrench, Holly Golightly, Dan Sartain, Martin Rev, Tortoise, The Ex, PyPy, Gary Wilson, Claw Hammer, Wau y Los Arrrghs</description>

                <description>Dinosaur Jr. is an American rock band formed in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1984, originally simply called Dinosaur until legal issues forced a change in name. The band was founded by J Mascis (guitar, vocals, primary songwriter), Lou Barlow (bass, vocals), and Murph (drums). After three albums on independent labels, the band earned a reputation as one of the formative influences on American alternative rock. Mascis&#39;s drawling vocals and distinct guitar sound, hearkening back to 1960s and 1970s classic rock and characterized by extensive use of feedback and distortion, were highly influential in the alternative rock movement of the 1990s.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lineup: &lt;br /&gt; Wipers, The Dream Syndicate, True West, The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Birthday Party, Throbbing Gristle, Venom, Accept, Saint Vitus, The Eastern Dark, The Neats, Green On Red, Meat Puppets</description>
