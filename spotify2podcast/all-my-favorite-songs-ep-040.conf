Bourdain was a figure who became synonymous with non-conformity and a determination to forge his own path, regardless of the hurdles in front of him. Whether through his progressive food, his dedication to the dive bar and all its inhabitants, or his adoration of all things punk, Anthony Bourdain was a bastion of anti-establishment splendour and he was determined to integrate his two passions.\n\n In this episode the list of perfect songs to cook to, created by Bourdain for his PBS show The Mind of a Chef, that aired in 6 seasons from 2012 to 2017."
