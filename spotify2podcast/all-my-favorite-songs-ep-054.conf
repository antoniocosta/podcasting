EP_DESCRIPTION="Benicio Monserrate Rafael del Toro Sanchez (born February 19, 1967) is a Puerto Rican actor and producer who emerged in the 1990s as a compelling character actor with a flair for oddball roles. Del Toro has garnered critical acclaim and numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards and a Silver Bear for his portrayal of the jaded but morally upright police officer Javier Rodriguez in the film Traffic (2000). Del Toro's performance as an ex-con turned zealot in despair Jack Jordan, in Alejandro Gonz√°lez Inarritu's 21 Grams (2003), earned him a second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\n In this episode, a playlist of Del Toro's favorite music artists, as shared by him during an interview with The Nerdist's Dan Casey in Aug 2014."
