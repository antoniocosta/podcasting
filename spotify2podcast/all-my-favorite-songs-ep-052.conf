EP_DESCRIPTION="DITZ is an English noise rock/post-punk band that formed in Brighton in 2016. The band is most well known for an erratic live show influenced by the hardcore punk and noise rock of the 80s and 90s, which sets them apart from their peers in the UK post-punk scene. DITZ consists of Cal Francis (vocals), Anton Mocock (Guitar), Sam Evans (Drums), Jack Looker (Guitar) and Caleb Remnant (bass).\n\n In this episode, a compilation of the five playlists created by each member of the band during the COVID lockdown, and published with a popular audio streaming provider (that shall remain unnamed), in May 2020."
