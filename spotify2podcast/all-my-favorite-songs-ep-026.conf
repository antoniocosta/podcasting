EP_DESCRIPTION="Jeffrey Lee Pierce (June 27, 1958 â€“ March 31, 1996) was an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and author, best remembered as the hard-living guitarist/singer frontman and one of the founding members of the The Gun Club, a band that fused the fury of punk with the melodic structures and lyrical obsessions of the blues, creating their own brand of swampy, ramshackle, psychotic, blues- influenced music.\n\n This episode is re-creation of a 1980 mixtape made by Jeffrey for Brad Dunning, the original drummer of The Gun Club."
