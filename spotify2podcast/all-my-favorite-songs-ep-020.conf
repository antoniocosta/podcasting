EP_DESCRIPTION="Run the Jewels, also known by the initialism RTJ, is an American hip hop super-duo composed of Brooklyn-based rapper and producer El-P, and Atlanta-based rapper Killer Mike. Atop hard-hitting beats and ominous production, the pair trade aggressive and often wryly comical rhymes, touching upon social issues, life and death, and a heavy dose of chest-thumping bragging. \n\n In this episode, part two of a series of two, all songs selected by Run The Jewels as guest for Australian TV show Rage, on March 21 2015."
