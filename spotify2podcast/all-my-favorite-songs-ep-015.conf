EP_DESCRIPTION="Roger "Buzz" Osborne (born March 25, 1964), also known as King Buzzo, is an American guitarist, vocalist and songwriter. He is a founding member of the Melvins, as well as Fant√¥mas and Venomous Concept. As founder of the Melvins, Buzz Osborne was one of the most influential figures in alternative rock during the 1980s and '90s and continued to produce a fascinating body of work well into the new millennium, though his impact often came second-hand. Osborne's massive, often sludgy guitar tone and bulldozer melodic structures were a major influence on the rise of the grunge scene in the Pacific Northwest as well as later varieties of off-center heavy rock, and as a mentor to his friend Kurt Cobain, Osborne helped guide Nirvana's early sound, and his importance was often cited by Cobain after Nevermind made him a major star."
