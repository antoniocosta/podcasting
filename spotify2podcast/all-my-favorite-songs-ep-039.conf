EP_DESCRIPTION="Lewis Allan Reed (March 2, 1942 - October 27, 2013) was an American musician, singer, songwriter, and poet. He was the guitarist, singer, and principal songwriter for the rock band the Velvet Underground and had a solo career that spanned five decades. Although not commercially successful during its existence, the Velvet Underground became regarded as one of the most influential bands in the history of underground and alternative rock music. Reed's distinctive deadpan voice, poetic and transgressive lyrics, and experimental guitar playing were trademarks throughout his long career.\n\n In this episode a compilation of Reed's final two playlists curated by himself (for a popular online music streaming platform that shall remain unnamed), before he passed in 2013, revealing what he was listening to in his final days."
