EP_DESCRIPTION="IDLES are a British rock band formed in Bristol in 2009. The band consists of Joe Talbot (vocals), Mark Bowen (guitar), Lee Kiernan (guitar), Adam Devonshire (bass) and Jon Beavis (drums).\n\n A self-proclaimed 'angry band' from Bristol in Southwest England, IDLES take the fury of punk rock and wed it to a muscular but moody instrumental attack that matches the literate, purposeful menace of their lyrics. Lead singer and lyricist Joe Talbot's full-bodied ranting, in which he offers his vehement opinions on the state of British culture and his own personal issues, is matched by the rich, angular blast of the musicians, who can swing from melodic to brutally hard at a moment's notice.\n\n In this episode all songs selected by IDLES as guests for Australian TV show Rage, on Saturday June 8, 2019."
