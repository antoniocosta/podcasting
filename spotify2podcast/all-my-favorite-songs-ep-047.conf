EP_DESCRIPTION="Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. (born October 20, 1971), known professionally as Snoop Dogg, is an American rapper and actor. One of the most iconic figures to emerge from the early-'90s G-funk era, Snoop Dogg evolved beyond his gangsta rap beginnings to become a lovable pop culture fixture with forays into television, movies, football coaching, and wrestling while expanding his musical reach far beyond his primary genre. Introduced through Dr. Dre's Top Five rap hit 'Deep Cover' (1992), Snoop quickly became one of the most famous stars in rap, partially due to his drawled, laconic rhyming, as well as the realistic violence implied in his lyrics.\n\n In 2012 Snoop converted to Rastafarianism and officially changed his stage name for the first time in 14 years to Snoop Lion. He released an album and a documentary under this name before changing his name once again only one year later in 2013.\n\n In this episode a playlist of songs created by Snoop during his Snoop Lion period, and published in a popular music streaming platform (that shall remain unnamed) between July 2012 and February 2013."
